### Hello!

Work stuff: I work at UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology as a data scientist. Working with biodiversity data (primarily citizen science data), analytics, modelling, visualisation and web interfaces. Working mostly in R, with bits of Python.

Non-work stuff: I like making little web things. [Hot Moths](https://simonrolph.github.io/hotmoths/) (a tinder-style dating site for moths), [iNaturalist Live](https://simonrolph.github.io/inatcounter/) (a world map of live activity on iNaturalist) and [Easily Missed](https://simonrolph.github.io/easily_missed/) (a tool for finding gaps in observations of regionally common species).
